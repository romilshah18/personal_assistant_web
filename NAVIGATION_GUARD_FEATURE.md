# 🛡️ Navigation Guard Feature - Active Conversation Protection

## Overview

This feature prevents users from accidentally navigating away from the assistant while they're in an active conversation. If a user tries to switch tabs during a conversation, they'll see a confirmation dialog explaining that navigation will stop their current session.

---

## 🎯 Feature Description

### Problem Solved
Users could accidentally navigate away from the Mic Screen while talking to the assistant, which would abruptly disconnect their conversation without warning.

### Solution
A navigation guard that:
1. Detects when a conversation is active
2. Shows a confirmation dialog if user tries to navigate away
3. Gives users the choice to:
   - **Stay** on the current tab and continue talking
   - **Leave** and automatically stop the conversation

   - Global state manager for conversation status
   - Tracks if conversation is active
   - Stores cleanup function for force-stopping conversations

### Modified Files
1. **`frontend/src/router/index.js`**
   - Added navigation guard in `beforeEach` hook
   - Shows confirmation dialog when leaving active conversation

2. **`frontend/src/composables/useAudioService.js`**

   - Sets conversation as inactive when stopping
   - Passes cleanup function to state manager

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Conversation State Manager

```javascript
// frontend/src/composables/useConversationState.js

// Global reactive state
const isConversationActive = ref(false)
const activeConversationCleanup = ref(null)

// Set conversation as active/inactive
setConversationActive(active, cleanupFn)

// Force stop conversation (called by router)
forceStopConversation()
```

### 2. Router Navigation Guard

```javascript
// frontend/src/router/index.js

router.beforeEach(async (to, from, next) => {
  // Check if leaving MicScreen with active conversation
  if (from.name === 'MicScreen' && to.name !== 'MicScreen' && isConversationActive.value) {
    // Show confirmation dialog
    const confirmed = window.confirm('⚠️ You are currently in an active conversation!...')
    
    if (!confirmed) {
      // Stay on current page
      next(false)
    } else {
      // Stop conversation and proceed
      await forceStopConversation()
      next()
    }
  } else {
    next()
  }
})
```

### 3. Audio Service Integration

```javascript
// frontend/src/composables/useAudioService.js

// When starting conversation
setConversationActive(true, stopRealtime)

// When stopping conversation
setConversationActive(false, null)

// In cleanup function
setConversationActive(false, null)
```

## 💬 User Experience

### Scenario 1: User Tries to Navigate During Conversation

```
User is talking → Clicks "Todo" tab → Sees dialog:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚠️ You are currently in an active     │
│     conversation!                       │
│                                         │
│  Navigating away will stop your        │
│  current session with the assistant.   │
│                                         │
│  Do you want to stop the conversation  │
│  and proceed?                           │
│                                         │
│  [ Cancel ]  [ OK ]                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

→ Cancel: Stays on Mic Screen, conversation continues
→ OK: Conversation stops, navigates to Todo tab
```

### Scenario 2: User Stops Conversation First

```
User clicks microphone to stop → No active conversation → Can navigate freely
```

---

## 🎨 Dialog Message

The confirmation dialog shows:
```
⚠️ You are currently in an active conversation!

Navigating away will stop your current session with the assistant.

Do you want to stop the conversation and proceed?
```

**Cancel Button**: Stay on Mic Screen
**OK Button**: Stop conversation and navigate

## 🚀 Usage

### As a User
1. **Start talking** to the assistant on the Mic Screen
2. **Try to navigate** to another tab (Todo, Learning, etc.)
3. **See the warning dialog**
4. **Choose**:
   - **Cancel** to continue your conversation
   - **OK** to stop and navigate away

### As a Developer
The system automatically:
- ✅ Tracks conversation state globally
- ✅ Shows dialog only when conversation is active
- ✅ Properly cleans up resources when stopping
- ✅ Works with all navigation methods (tab clicks, browser back, etc.)

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: Conversation is properly stopped when user confirms navigation
2. **State Consistency**: Conversation state is always synchronized
3. **Multiple Exit Points**: Cleanup happens in multiple places (stop, cleanup, error)
4. **Resource Management**: All WebRTC connections and audio streams are properly closed
5. **No Memory Leaks**: State is cleared when conversation ends

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### State Management
- **Global State**: Uses Vue 3 reactive refs
- **Composable Pattern**: Shared across components
- **Cleanup Function**: Stored and called when needed

### Navigation Guard
- **Timing**: Runs before each navigation
- **Async Support**: Properly handles async cleanup
- **Return Values**:
  - `next(false)` - Cancel navigation
  - `next()` - Allow navigation

### Conversation Lifecycle
```
Start → Set Active (true, cleanupFn)
  ↓
User Navigates → Check Active → Show Dialog
  ↓
User Confirms → Force Stop → Set Active (false, null)
  ↓
Navigate → Session Ended
```
