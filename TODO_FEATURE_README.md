## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Created

#### `todo_categories`
- Stores user's todo categories
- Default categories: Work, Personal, Grocery, Learning, Others
- Users can create custom categories
- Color and icon support for visual organization

#### `todos`
- Main todos table
- Fields: title, description, due_date, status, priority
- Links to categories and sessions
- Tracks conversation-created todos

### Key Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Auto-timestamps for created_at and updated_at
- Automatic default category creation for new users
- Cascade deletes for data integrity

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Todo Operations
- `POST /api/tools/todo_actions` - Main todo operations endpoint
  - Actions: list, create, update, delete, complete, today, upcoming, overdue

### Category Management
- `GET /api/todos/categories` - List all categories
- `POST /api/todos/categories` - Create new category
- `PUT /api/todos/categories/:id` - Update category
- `DELETE /api/todos/categories/:id` - Delete category

### Statistics
- `GET /api/todos/stats` - Get todo statistics

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL schema in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Open Supabase dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor
# Copy and paste contents of todo-schema.sql
# Run the script
```

This will:
- Create todo_categories and todos tables
- Set up indexes for performance
- Enable Row Level Security
- Create default categories for existing users
- Set up triggers for automatic timestamps

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend code is already implemented in `server.js`. No additional setup needed.

### 3. Frontend Setup
The frontend code is already implemented. No additional setup needed.

### 4. Test the Feature
1. Navigate to the Todo tab in your app
2. Try creating a todo manually
3. Test the AI integration by talking to your assistant:
   - "I need to buy milk tomorrow"
   - "What do I need to do today?"
   - "I finished the presentation"

## 💬 AI Conversation Examples

### Creating Todos
**User:** "I need to buy groceries tomorrow at 5pm"
**AI:** *Creates todo with title "Buy groceries", category "Grocery", due date tomorrow at 5pm*

**User:** "Remind me to call John about the project next Monday"
**AI:** *Creates todo with title "Call John about the project", category "Work", due date next Monday*

### Checking Todos
**User:** "What do I need to do today?"
**AI:** *Shows todos due today and overdue items*

**User:** "Show me my work tasks"
**AI:** *Lists all todos in the Work category*

### Completing Todos
**User:** "I finished the report"
**AI:** *Marks matching todo as complete*

**User:** "Mark buy milk as done"
**AI:** *Completes the "buy milk" todo*

## 🎨 UI Components

### Main Screen
- **Stats Cards**: Quick overview of todo status
- **Filter Tabs**: Switch between Active, All, and Completed views
- **Category Pills**: Filter by category with visual indicators
- **Todo Cards**: Display todos with checkbox, details, and actions

### Add/Edit Modal
- Title input (required)
- Description textarea
- Category dropdown
- Priority selector
- Due date picker
- Status selector (edit mode only)

### Features
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter to save in forms
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback
- **Loading States**: Spinner while fetching data
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no todos

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Auto-Categorization
The system automatically categorizes todos based on keywords:
- **Work**: meeting, presentation, report, project, client, deadline, etc.
- **Grocery**: buy, grocery, shopping, store, milk, bread, food, etc.
- **Learning**: learn, study, read, course, tutorial, practice, etc.
- **Personal**: home, family, friend, doctor, appointment, etc.
- **Others**: Default category if no match

### Smart Sorting
Todos are automatically sorted by:
1. Overdue items (shown first with red indicator)
2. Due date (earliest first)
3. Priority (high > medium > low)

### Session Tracking
Todos created via AI conversation are linked to the session, allowing you to:
- See which conversation created the todo
- Track conversation-generated vs manually created todos
- Analyze AI-generated task patterns

## 🎯 Usage Tips

### For Best Results
1. **Be Specific**: Include when tasks need to be done
2. **Use Keywords**: Mention "buy", "call", "meeting", etc. for auto-categorization
3. **Set Due Dates**: Always specify when you need to complete tasks
4. **Review Regularly**: Check the "Due Today" view each morning

### Voice Commands
- "Add to my todo list: [task]"
- "What's on my todo list?"
- "Show me my work tasks"
- "I completed [task name]"
- "What do I need to do today?"

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Possible features to add later:
- 📅 Calendar integration (sync with Google Calendar)
- 🔄 Recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly)
- 📎 File attachments
- 🏷️ Tags and labels
- 👥 Shared todos (collaboration)
- 📊 Analytics and productivity insights
- 🔔 Push notifications for due dates
- ⏰ Smart reminders based on location/time
- 🎙️ Voice input for quick todo creation
- 📱 Mobile app notifications

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Todos Not Loading
- Check if database schema is applied
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check browser console for errors

### Categories Not Showing
- Run the SQL script to create default categories
- Check if the user_id matches authenticated user

### AI Not Creating Todos
- Ensure you're in "todo mode" by saying "manage my todos"
- Use explicit keywords like "I need to" or "remind me to"
- Check backend logs for tool call responses
